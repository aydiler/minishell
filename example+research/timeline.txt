**Best Order to Implement Functions for a Custom Shell with Two Coders**

Implementing a custom shell is a complex task that involves multiple features, each with its own dependencies and challenges. To efficiently develop the shell with two coders, it's crucial to plan the implementation order carefully, ensuring that dependencies are satisfied and both coders can work in parallel as much as possible. Below is the recommended order of implementation, along with the division of tasks between the two coders.

---

### **Phase 1: Core Shell Loop and Basic Command Execution**

**1. Implement Basic Shell Loop with Prompt Display**

- **Coder A:**
  - Set up the main loop that displays a static prompt (e.g., `minishell$ `).
  - Use basic input methods like `readline` or `fgets` to read user input.
  - **Dependencies:** None significant at this stage.

Check:
Display prompt for commands X

**2. Implement Basic Command Parsing (Simple Tokenization)**

- **Coder B:**
  - Develop a simple parser to split the input line into command and arguments.
  - Handle basic whitespace tokenization without quotes or special characters.
  - **Dependencies:** None significant at this stage.

**4. Implement Command Execution of Simple Commands**

- **Coder A:**
  - Implement the execution of simple external commands without arguments.
  - Use `fork` and `execve` to run commands found in the system's `PATH`.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Basic command parsing to obtain the command name.

Check:
Execute commands using absolute paths X
Execute commands using relative paths X
Execute commands using PATH X

**14. Implement Command History Using `readline`**

- **Coder B:**
  - Integrate `add_history` to store commands entered by the user.
  - Ensure history is cleared on shell exit using `rl_clear_history`.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Use of `readline` for input.

CHECK
Working command history using readline X


**3. Implement Basic Signal Handling (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-\)**

- **Coder A:**
  - Set up signal handlers for `SIGINT`, `SIGQUIT`, and `EOF` detection.
  - Ensure that `Ctrl-C` interrupts the current input and displays a new prompt.
  - Detect `Ctrl-D` (EOF) to exit the shell gracefully.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Minimal interaction with the input loop.

CHECK
Global variable for signals only X
ctrl-C: New prompt on new line X
ctrl-D: Exit shell X
ctrl-: No action X

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Command Parsing and Environment Management**

**5. Enhance Command Parsing to Handle Single and Double Quotes**

- **Coder B:**
  - Modify the parser to handle single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes.
  - Ensure that quoted strings are treated as single arguments.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Existing basic command parsing.

**6. Implement Environment Variable Management**

- **Coder A:**
  - Create data structures to manage shell environment variables.
  - Implement functions to get and set environment variables.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Required for variable expansion and built-in commands like `export`.

**7. Implement Variable Expansion (`$VAR`, `$?`) in Command Parsing**

- **Coder B:**
  - Modify the parser to detect `$VAR` and replace it with its value.
  - Implement special handling for `$?` to display the last exit status.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Environment variable management.
    - Enhanced command parsing with quote handling.

---

### **Phase 3: Implement Built-in Commands**

**8. Implement Built-in Commands: `echo`, `pwd`, `exit`**

- **Coder A:**
  - **`echo`:**
    - Handle the `-n` option to suppress the trailing newline.
  - **`pwd`:**
    - Display the current working directory using `getcwd`.
  - **`exit`:**
    - Terminate the shell with an optional exit status.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Command parsing to handle arguments.

**9. Implement Built-in Commands: `cd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`**

- **Coder A:**
  - **`cd`:**
    - Change the current directory and update `PWD` and `OLDPWD`.
  - **`export`:**
    - Set environment variables from `VAR=VALUE` pairs.
  - **`unset`:**
    - Remove variables from the environment.
  - **`env`:**
    - Display the current environment variables.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Environment variable management.
    - Command parsing for argument handling.

---

### **Phase 4: Redirections and Pipes**

**10. Enhance Command Parsing to Handle Redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<`)**

- **Coder B:**
  - Extend the parser to identify redirection operators and their targets.
  - Store redirection information for use during command execution.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Enhanced command parsing with quote and variable handling.

**11. Modify Command Execution to Handle Redirections**

- **Coder A:**
  - Implement input (`<`) and output (`>`, `>>`) redirection using `dup2`.
  - Handle here-documents (`<<`) by reading input until a delimiter is matched.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Parsed redirection information.
    - Command execution framework.

**12. Enhance Command Parsing to Handle Pipes (`|`)**

- **Coder B:**
  - Modify the parser to split commands separated by the pipe symbol.
  - Store each command segment for sequential execution.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Existing command parsing and redirection handling.

**13. Modify Command Execution to Handle Pipes**

- **Coder A:**
  - Implement inter-process communication using `pipe`.
  - Set up multiple processes where the output of one is the input of the next.
  - Ensure proper file descriptor management to prevent leaks.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Parsed pipe information.
    - Command execution and redirection mechanisms.

### **Phase 5: Command History and Final Touches**



**15. Finalize Signal Handling and Integration with `readline`**

- **Coder A:**
  - Refine signal handlers to work seamlessly with `readline`.
  - Ensure that signals like `Ctrl-C` interrupt input appropriately.
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Signal handling.
    - Use of `readline` for command input.

### **Summary of Task Division**

- **Coder A (Shell Loop and Execution):**
  - Basic shell loop and prompt display.
  - Signal handling.
  - Command execution of external and built-in commands.
  - Environment variable management.
  - Handling of redirections and pipes during execution.
  - Final signal handling integration.

- **Coder B (Command Parsing and History):**
  - Basic and advanced command parsing.
  - Handling of quotes and variable expansion.
  - Parsing of redirections and pipes.
  - Implementation of command history.
  - Final touches on command parsing features.

---

### **Rationale Behind the Order**

- **Dependencies Are Respected:**
  - Each feature is implemented after its dependencies are satisfied.
  - For example, environment variable expansion is added after environment management is in place.

- **Parallel Work Is Maximized:**
  - Coders work on separate but complementary components.
  - While one works on command parsing, the other focuses on execution and environment management.

- **Testing and Integration:**
  - Implementing features in this order allows for incremental testing.
  - Basic functionality is verified before adding more complex features.

- **Complex Features Built on Solid Foundations:**
  - Advanced features like redirections and pipes are added after basic execution works.
  - Ensures a stable base to handle more intricate behaviors.

---

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Communication Between Coders:**
  - Regular synchronization meetings to integrate parsing and execution components.
  - Shared understanding of data structures for commands and environment variables.

- **Version Control:**
  - Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage code changes.
  - Feature branches can be used to develop and test features independently before merging.

- **Testing Plan:**
  - Develop a suite of test cases for each feature.
  - Automated tests can help catch regressions as new features are added.

- **Documentation:**
  - Comment code thoroughly to aid understanding.
  - Maintain documentation for functions and modules, especially for complex parsing logic.

By following this implementation plan, the two coders can efficiently develop a custom shell that gradually builds up functionality while respecting feature dependencies. This approach ensures a manageable development process and results in a robust and fully functional shell.
